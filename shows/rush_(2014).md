### Rush

Genres: Action, Drama

Doctor William Rush is not your average on-call professional.
He's not attached to any hospital, he's highly discreet -- no matter the ailment, his clients must pay a cash-only premium, and the doctor can party with the best of them.
Dr. Rush has no desire to change his life or how he lives it, until an old flame and his conscience begin to stir things up.
