Shadow is a man with a past.
But now he wants nothing more than to live a quiet life with his wife and stay out of trouble.
Until he learns that she's been killed in a terrible accident.
Flying home for the funeral, as a violent storm rocks the plane, he is greeted by a strange man in the seat next to him.
The man calls himself Mr. Wednesday, and he knows more about Shadow than is possible.
He warns Shadow that a far bigger storm is coming.
And from that moment on, nothing will ever be the same.
