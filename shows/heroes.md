### Heroes

Genres: Drama, Fantasy, Sci-Fi

People all over the U.S and the world start to realize they have special abilities, like telekinesis, healing abilities, flying powers, time travel, invisibility, and the ability to absorb other's abilities.
One man, known as Sylar, wants to gain all the power of these "heroes" so he can be the most powerful and evolved human of all, and stops at nothing to gruesomely kill these people.
In order to protect themselves from him, these people must help one another before Sylar can destroy them all, while they each deal with problems of their own.
