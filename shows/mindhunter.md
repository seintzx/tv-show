### Mindhunter

Genres: Crime, Drama, Mystery

Two FBI agents, fighting the departmental stigma of backroom boys - those who try to complicate the status quo of simple Means, Motive, Opportunity (MMO) of crime-solving with academics - work to develop an innovative investigative field incorporating psychology, anthropology and sociology as a method to reveal the motive.
They acknowledge classic crime-solving - MMO - as no longer sufficient because criminality is becoming more complicated as Motive graduates from need and greed to inexplicable and irrational reasons.
They theorize applying deeper psychological evaluation will posit new questions.
Simply, asking Why will lead to the Who.
This series focuses on the development by two men, two agents, of a new criminal field and does so through story lines of visiting the sociopathic mind.
