### Hackerville

Genres: Action, Thriller

When a hacking attack on a major German bank is traced to Romania, BKA cyber-crime expert Lisa Metz (Anna Schumacher) is dispatched from Frankfurt to Timisoara, the city of her birth, to work with local investigators.
Arriving in the country her parents fled when she was a child, Lisa finds it at the same time both distantly familiar and utterly alien.
For the first time in her life she must also confront her family's shadowy past.
The culture clash is felt most keenly with local Timisoara PD officer Adam Sandor (Andi Vasluianu), her assigned partner for the investigation, who has a very different mindset which Lisa finds deeply frustrating - and the feeling is mutual.
But as the two cops get embroiled in the high-stakes investigation, they grow close on the back of the need to save an unlikely target: the savvy but vulnerable 14-year-old gamer Cipi (newcomer Voicu Dumitras).
